# hackerRank-C-solution

This repository contains solutions for a few HackerRank practice problems implemented in C++.

Contents
 - `AttributePraser/AttributePraser.md` — HRML Attribute Parser problem statement and a working C++ solution (includes parsing code and example input/output).
 - `Class&Object/Class&Object.md` — A simple `Student` class exercise (reading student scores and counting how many scored higher than Kristen) with a complete C++ implementation.

Quick notes
- Both challenge files are stored as Markdown files that include the problem description, sample I/O, and a C++ code block with the solution. To compile and run any solution, copy the C++ code block into a `.cpp` file and compile it with your C++ compiler.

Example (one-time steps)
1. Create a .cpp from the Markdown code block (example for Attribute Parser):

```bash
# copy the C++ code block from AttributePraser/AttributePraser.md into AttributePraser.cpp
```

2. Compile and run (example):

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o attr_parser AttributePraser.cpp
./attr_parser < sample_input.txt
```

Replace `AttributePraser.cpp` with the filename you created, and `sample_input.txt` with a file that contains the sample input (or provide input interactively).

If you want, I can extract the C++ code blocks into standalone `.cpp` files and add sample input files and build tasks. Tell me which one you'd like me to prepare next.
